\chapter{Hypergraph Linguistic Model}
\label{chap:ling_net}
\begin{abstractchap}
We present in this chapter our model proposition to stock linguistic data. This structure, based on the concept of hypergraphs, holds heterogeneous textual features, improving on the limitations of common solutions of the state of the art. At the same time, our network allows for fast access to words and their properties from different points of view. Finally, we also discuss our motivations and the scope and limitations of the network.

Building upon previous linguistic representations \cite{2007.Klapaftis.UOY,2011.Haishan.AHypergraphbased,2014.Tao.Qian.LexicalChainHypergraphWSI}, our model is also based on the use of a hypergraph.
% As stated before, hypergraphs have been employed in the literature to model complex systems. 
Their single most important difference with regular graphs, being able to relate more than two vertices at the same type, allows for a better characterization of interactions within a set of individual elements (in our case, words) \cite{heintz2014beyond}. Indeed, our hypergraph modelization initially integrates four types of relations between tokens: sentence co-occurrence, part-of-speech tags, words' constituents data and dependency relations in a single linguistic structure. These relationships were chosen because its is relatively easy to obtain them for high-resource languages. These features can be seen as building blocks for NLP models. Extracting deeper language features would implicate relying even more on general domain systems. In any case, our goal is to arrive to more complex annotations (e.g., named entities) from the selected features and relations.
 
 %
 %Formally, a hypergraph is a generalization of a graph defined as a tuple $G=(V,E)$, where the vertices $V = \{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n\}$ represent the set of nodes and  $E = \{e_1, e_2, ...,e_m\}$  the set of hyperedges which contains links between two or more vertices 
\section{Characteristics of our proposition}
In our model we group words together according to these features, into a  hypergraph schema. Formally, a hypergraph \cite{Berge1985} is a graph generalization  that allows more than two vertices to be linked by a single edge. Let $V$ denote a finite set of objects, and let $E$  (the hyperarcs
or hyperedges) be a
group of subsets  of $V$ such that $V = \cup_{e_j \in E}e_j$. We call $\mathcal{H}=(V,E)$ a {hypergraph}
with the {vertex} set $V$ and the hyperedge set $E$. A
hyperedge containing just two nodes is a simple graph edge.
%A \emph{weighted hypergraph} is a hypergraph that has a positive number $w(e)$ associated with each hyperedge, called the \emph{weight} of the hyperedge $e$. A \emph{weigted hypergraph} is then denoted by $\mathcal{H}=(V,E,w)$.
%
A hyperedge $e$ is said to be \emph{incident} with a vertex $v$ when
$v \in e$.
% As one can see, as in graph theory, the adjacency is referred to the elements of the same kind (vertices vs vertices, or edges vs edges), while the incidence is referred to the elements of different kind (vertices vs edges).


In our case, the set of tokens in the corpus are the set of nodes  $V$, and the set of hyperedges  $E$ represent the relations between nodes according to different linguistic aspects.
%
Each hyperedge may be one of three types: noun phrase\footnote{In this work we consider only noun phrases (NPs). Still, we can easily add other type of phrase chunks.}   constituents (\textit{CONST}), dependency relations (\textit{DEPENDENCY}), or sentence context (\textit{SENTENCE}). We consider that a token $v$ belongs to a hyperedge $e_j$ of type {NP} or {SENTENCE} if the token appears in the same noun phrase or in the same sentence. A token $v$ belongs to a hyperedge of type {DEPENDENCY} if it is the dependent of a certain dependency relation coupled with its corresponding head (or governor).	The hypergraph can be represented as a $n \times m$ incidence $H$ matrix with entries $h(i,j) = N(v_i, e_j)$ where $N(v_i, e_j)$ is the number of times $v_i \in e_j$ occurs in the corpus.


We illustrate our hypergraph incidence matrix with the following example  phrase: \textit{The report contains copies of the minutes of these meetings}. We tokenize the phrase, keeping all the words, and we lemmatize and parse it to obtain both constituency and dependency trees.

 The constituency tree of the example phrase is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tree}. The sentence, as well as each noun phrase (NP) node is identified by a number. We can observe that this phrase is composed by five noun phrases (NP) and one verb phrase. Meanwhile, some of the NPs are formed by other kind of phrases, depending on the grammar production rule used to build each one of them. As is usual in this kind of structures, there is a one to one relation between the number of tokens in the sentence  and the number of leaves in the tree.

 \end{figure}
 
 The dependencies of the example phrase are shown in Table \ref{tab:depends}.  They indicate the syntactic relation between the	  governor of a phrase and  dependent. In these relations' examples, the head is the first token to appear  followed by the dependent word.

 \textbf{case}(minutes, of)       & \textbf{nmod}(minutes, meetings)
 \end{tabular}
 \end{table}
 
  From both of these types of information we can build a hypergraph representation as stated before. The incidence matrix is illustrated in Table \ref{tab:incidence}.  For brevity, we  only show nouns as well as only the first three noun phrases and the nominal subject (\textit{nsubj}) and direct object (\textit{dobj}) dependency relations. 
%
Looking at the table, we can   infer that the word \textit{copies} appears  in two hyperedges of type CONSTITUENT: first in NP$_2$, which is built from a NP  and two prepositional phrases (PP). Secondly, we see that it is part of NP$_3$, which  indicates a plural noun (NNS).

Regarding the syntactic dependency hyperedges, the word \textit{copies} appear in the \textit{dobj} \textit{contains} column which indicates that \textit{copies} was the direct object of the verb \textit{contains}.
 
For the sentence hyperedges, we see that the token \textit{copies} appeared in the same sentence S$_1$ as the other four noun words.

With this short example we show the intuitive way in which we store three different kinds of relations: lexical co-occurrence, dependency co-occurrence and sentence (at chunk level) co-occurrence.
% We can thus build systems that allow us to interpret a word from different perspectives according to said relations.


%In order to apply the proposed linguistic network to an input corpus we first need to parse it and thus obtain the required information from it to populate the hypergraph. In the following, we describe the method used to extract and store linguistic information from the English Wikipedia. %The procedure begins by extracting the text from an English Wikipedia dump and concludes by saving into disk the Wikipedia corpus in the format of our proposed language network (represented as a hypergraph incidence matrix with its complementary metadata information about the meaning of each vertex and hyperedge). 

In the following section we set to solve a natural language processing task using the model described above. Specifically, we address the word sense induction and disambiguation challenges. Both tasks are located on the computational semantics sub-domain of NLP. By making use of the network we want to test the effectiveness of using different types of linguistic features.

\section{Wikipedia Syntactic Dump}
In order to have a working dataset, we first built a software that process and parse any input corpus. We describe its properties, its inputs, the information extracted, as well as the output generated by the software.



\subsection{Introduction and Related Work}
Today, the broad reach of Wikipedia in Text Mining (TM) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) research  is indisputable. Several recent approaches and tools have  been conducted based on the explicit and implicit knowledge contained in it. Certainly, Wikipedia provides a common ground for researchers and developers to test and compare their results.

Wikipedia has been used as a source of valuable data as well as a common background corpus to perform experiments and compare results for diverse NLP/TM related tasks. For example, concerning the first case, in the area of Information Extraction, Wikipedia's infoboxes structured information is used in \cite{Wu2010} as a valuable resource to complement and improve their open IE system. Along the same line, \cite{charton2010}  extracted metadata from Wikipedia while leveraging its internal structure in order to produce a semantically annotated corpus. Moving on to the Information Retrieval field, features extracted from Wikipedia can also help to better predict the performance of a query  \cite{katz2014} in a given  corpus.  In the second case, as a background collection for experiments, a document-aligned version of English and Italian Wikipedia has been used to determine the quality between word's translations \cite{vulic2011}.  

Wikipedia, being such a popular resource  already has various off-the-shelf parsed snapshots (or dumps). These parsed dumps allow researchers to focus more into their approaches than into the extraction and transformation of Wikipedia's data.  We briefly describe certain relevant parses found in the literature.   
%



%The already mentioned parsed dump from \cite{ATSERIAS08}
A relevant Wikipedia parsed dump example comes from \cite{ATSERIAS08}. Their work provides a balanced amount of syntactic and semantic information. In short, the dump includes each word's Part-of-Speech (PoS) tag, their dependency relations as well as the output of three different named entity recognition parsers. Additionally, they provide a graph structure that leverages Wikipedia's internal composition alongside its corresponding metadata. Nonetheless, the resource is no longer available on the original URL although it may be obtained through Yahoo's Webscope\footnote{\url{https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/}} datasets library.  In \cite{FLICKINGER10}, they perform a deep parse analysis is performed to provide detailed syntactic and semantic information. The authors leverage a previously manually annotated portion of the English Wikipedia. They extract a grammar from this portion and also train a statistical model  to automatically parse the rest of Wikipedia. Even though the parse offered is deep and rich in details, the annotation labels, as well as the corpus output format, may not be convenient and easy to use because of its complexity and particular nature. \cite{SchenkelSK07}  released a purely semantic XML parse that links WordNet concepts to Wikipedia pages. They focus greatly on cleaning and pre-treating Wikipedia. In this paper we do not focus as much into the cleaning of Wikipedia as already available tools can solve the task quite well for non-specific needs. 
Finally, there are certain Wikipedia dumps that offer the raw cleaned text without any extra subsequent parsing or analysis. Such is the case of the corpus made available by \cite{westbury2010}. This corpus makes  use of the \textit{WikiExtractor} script  \cite{Attardi2015} to clean the Wikipedia dump.
  
  
Although the existing parses and dumps already satisfy numerous specific research needs, they have certain limitations that drove us to build our own resource: the Syntactically Annotated English Wikipedia  Dump (SAEWD). Specifically, we address the following shortcomings: the lack of constituents-based tree information, the complex output formats, the limited online access and the absence of the tools used (i.e., the source code) to create the annotated corpus. In SAEWD we include the complete parse tree information for each word provided by well-known parsing tools. We store the extracted information in a simple and already existing output format. Additionally, we give open access to the parsed dump and we share our source code with the community. The code allows anyone (with programming skills) to  apply our processing pipeline and build their own particular Wikipedia parse or even to parse other text collections. Finally, we present and provide a hypergraph linguistic network for fast NLP/TM experimentation. Indeed, SAEWD aims to be used as a stepping stone for a standard Wikipedia parsed version for the largest possible set of tasks in future research. 

SAEWD uses widely known English language parsing tools, namely those included in the Stanford CoreNLP suite.  Aside from being accessible and regularly maintained, it provides a common set of labels (Universal Dependencies\footnote{\url{http://universaldependencies.github.io/docs/}}) used by numerous NLP and TM experiments. Regarding SAEWD output's format, we believe that the file format we use, which follows  that of \cite{ATSERIAS08}, allows for fast reading and simple interpretation. Among other syntactical information, we provide the constituents parse branch for each word (explained in detail in Section \ref{text:description}). 
Constituent's paths, and hence chunk's production rules, have been proved useful as a complement feature to classic text representations \cite{sagae2009,Bergsma2012,Massung2013}. 
%This information is commonly missed by most Wikipedia parses. It may be due to the fact that it may not be easy or clear to use the constituents nodes information; or may be because storing a tree branch is not as straightforward as stocking a single relationship type label, as is the case of a dependency parse.

As a second contribution, we propose a hypergraph linguistic representation. Over the past few years, research on the NLP domain has been focusing on novel techniques that take advantage of the characteristics of language networks to achieve new and interesting results \cite{Mihalcea11}. That is why, in addition to SAEWD, we also propose, as a proof of concept, a hypergraph representation that stores certain information found in a SAEWD in a practical way that allows for fast and effortless data extraction. This hypergraph can be indeed considered as a Linguistic Network \cite{Choudhury09}.  It aims to facilitate the implementation of graph-based approaches by allowing researchers to jump directly into the algorithm development stage. We use a sub-sample of the Wikipedia corpus consisting of articles related to Natural Language Processing and Text Mining. 
% Our parsed dump,  the source code used to generate it, the network and its metadata will be online and available for LREC 2016.

In the following sections we describe the steps we undertook to transform a Wikipedia dump into SAEWD (Section 2), we give a detailed account of the contents of SAEWD and the format in which we stored the parsed information (Section 3), then we explain the characteristics of our proposed network structure (Section 4). Lastly, we present our final comments on the nature of the work done as well as possible future work perspectives.

	\caption{The tree steps we took to build SAEWD.}
	\label{fig:flow}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Construction of SAEWD}
The three main steps we followed to build SAEWD are presented in Figure \ref{fig:flow}. Briefly, we have one input, which is the Wikipedia dump and one output which is the parsed snapshot. In the following we provide a detailed description of each of the process. 

 
We begin the construction of the parsed corpus with the Wikipedia dump XML file obtained from the Wikipedia database\footnote{\url{https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki}} from early November 2014. This dump  contains around 4.7 million article pages\footnote{We kept all articles available in the Wikipedia dump.}. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:flow}, we apply the following processing steps in order to yield the final parsed version.
 
\subsubsection{Cleaning Wikipedia} First, we discard Wikipedia's  tables, references and lists, markup annotations and HTML tags with the \textit{WikiExtractor} \cite{Attardi2015}  script. 
We used this tool to clean and split the content of the original XML file into 429 folders each one containing 100 files of approximately 300 kB. These files contain a certain number of complete Wikipedia articles which is automatically determined by WikiExtractor  according to the maximum possible size assigned for each file, 300 kB in our case, thus the number of articles in each file may vary. We decided to use numerous files as well as a small size to easily read their content into memory while parsing. Having multiple small files also makes it easier to handle the multi-threading aspect of our parsing tool.
We kept WikiExtractor's original folder nomenclature which assigns to each one of them a sequence of letters sorted lexicographically\footnote{We have folders named \textit{AA}, \textit{AB}, \textit{AC} and so on.}. The files containing the cleaned text is simply named \textit{wiki\_XX} where  \textit{XX} goes from 00 to 99, as we have 100 files per folder. 
It is important to note that the Wikipedia articles' titles themselves are not sorted in any specific way, as it was not in the interest of our research to have them ordered. 
Inside each cleaned file, besides the article's text, WikiExtractor keeps the original article's URL as well as its unique Wikipedia ID within an XML-like label that also doubles as  article separator. 

\subsubsection{Parsing Wikipedia} Next, once the Wikipedia dump had been cleaned, we use the Stanford CoreNLP\footnote{\url{http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml}} \cite{manning2014} analysis tools to parse all the file texts produced during the previous step. As a part of our processing pipeline, we first perform  sentence segmentation, word tokenization and lemmatization. Below, we briefly describe each of the extracted attributes. We also exemplify them in detail in Section \ref{text:description}.
\begin{itemize}
\item PoS tagging: We obtain the grammatical category of each word, i.e., the part-of-speech tag, using the CoreNLP default tagger, the \textit{left3words} PoS tagging model.
\item Dependency parse: this attribute consists on an extracted tree that describes the types of grammatical relations between words, i.e., the dependency-based parse tree. 
The analysis was performed with the Stanford's \textit{Shift-Reduce}  parser.
% This parser is known to perform better than other Stanford parsers.                                  
 %(notably  faster and  with stronger \textit{F1} measure than the previous PCFG parser, although not as accurate as the Recurrent Neural Network system trained with semantic word vectors).
As information representation, we use the basic dependencies scheme, as we wanted to include each one of the possible dependency relations without any collapsing between them.    
                                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                    
\item Constituents parse:                                                                                                                                                           
the output of this analysis is a rooted tree that represents the syntactic structure of a phrase.                                                                                  
This tree is commonly known as the constituency-based parse tree.                                                                                                                  
For each word, we store its complete path in the constituency tree.
 Specifically, we keep all the nodes of a word's own branch from the root to the word itself.
 We employ the Stanford Shift-Reduce parser.
 This path is transformed into a single line and included in SAEWD.

 Finally, once the parsing process is complete, the parsed files are stored into individual files and thus there are as much parsed files as input Wikipedia cleaned files. The parsed files keep their original name plus the \texttt{parsed} extension, e.g., \texttt{wiki\_00.parsed}. The structure within the files is described in Section \ref{section3.2}. After parsing, we found the statistics shown in Table \ref{tab:corpus_stats}.

\subsubsection{Constituency parse storage in detail}
%The  result from the constituency parse is not as straightforward to store as the other kinds of parses, i.e., the output is  a deeper tree structure than that of a dependency parse. Thus, we believe that the storage of this information in SAEWD requires a more in detail explanation. 
%In this subsection, we will describe how we stock the information concerning  the phrases' constituents. 

We will use an example to better explain the storage of the constituency-based parse tree. In Figure \ref{fig:tree} we can see the constituency parse of the phrase  \textit{A great brigand becomes a ruler of a Nation}. On the bottom of the figure, we observe the constituent's path (or branch), of the words \textit{brigand} and \textit{Nation}. As in any tree structure, each leaf node has a defined path from the root node to itself. In this example, the leaf containing the noun \textit{brigand} 
%(PoS tag \textit{NN})
 follows the bottom-up path \textit{NP22}$\rightarrow$\textit{S97}. \textit{Brigand's} parent node is a Noun Phrase (NP) node which in turn comes from the root of the tree, the Sentence node \textit{S}. We assign to each phrase chunk an identifier (22 and 97 in this case) in order to distinguish them according to their building elements as specified by the grammar rule used.
  In other words, a phrase chunk, e.g., a NP, a Verbal Phrase (VP), a Prepositional Phrase (PP), or other chunk defined by the grammar in CoreNLP, may be built from different types of PoS tags. Thus, again from Figure \ref{fig:tree}, we see that the sentence \textit{S97} is  built both from a NP and a VP chunk. 
 In a similar way, the noun phrase \textit{NP18} is produced by a determinant (DT) and a noun (NN), while  \textit{NP22} is generated by a determinant, an adjective (JJ) and a noun.
  The identification digits are obtained from the hash code that represents each chunk object inside our Java application. For each phrase-chunk tree node, we keep the last two significative figures produced by the \texttt{hashCode}\footnote{Java \texttt{hashCode} function description: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java\_hashCode\%28\%29}} Java method.

% On the bottom, we can see the bottom-up path stored for the words \textit{brigand} and \textit{Nation}.
}
\label{fig:tree}
\end{figure}

 


As another example, the noun \textit{Nation} has the following bottom-up constituency path: \textit{NP18}$\rightarrow$\textit{PP57}$\rightarrow$\textit{NP20}$\rightarrow $\textit{VP44}. Indeed, the string \texttt{NP\_18,PP\_57,NP\_20,VP\_44,S\_97}, originating from the previously described path,  is the information we keep about the constituency parse for each token in the Wikipedia dump.



\subsubsection{Annotation scheme}\label{section3.2}
To store the parsed text we use a scheme  inspired by that used in \cite{ATSERIAS08}. The format can be considered as a regular tsv file (i.e., the entries are separated by tab spaces) with additional metadata tags. An extract from a parsed file can be observed in Table \ref{tab:parse}. 

The file includes two headers: the first one simply indicates the name of the current parse file; the second one contains the names that describe each column. The tags and columns our parsed dump contains are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Metadata tags:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {FILENAME}: indicates the original file used to extract the current parse, 
\item {\%\%\#PAGE}: denotes a new Wikipedia article, as well as its title, 
\item {\%\%\#SEN}: marks the beginning of a new sentence. It is followed by two integers: (1) the number of the current sentence, and (2), the number of tokens in the sentence.

\end{enumerate}

\item Parse columns for each token:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Token: the token itself,
\item Lemma: the token the canonical form,
\item POS: its part of speech tag,
\item Constituency: the bottom-up constituency path described before,
\item Head: the head index of the dependency relation the current token belongs to,
\item Constituency: the name of the grammatical relationship this token participates in as a dependent.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

Using the example phrase introduced before (Table \ref{tab:parse}), the token \textit{becomes} has \textit{become} as lemma, it is a verb, thus it has \textit{VBZ} as PoS tag, its constituency path is \textit{VP\_44,S\_97}, so it belongs to the verb phrase {VP44} which in turn comes from sentence {S97}. Finally, \textit{becomes}, being the main verb, is in this case the grammatical root of the sentence and its head is by convention determined as  zero. 

Concerning the computation time, SAEWD takes around 40 hours to be produced using a general purpose laptop (Intel i7 4700MQ with 4 cores, 8 GB and Linux Mint 17 as operative system). Most of the time is taken by the parsing step. 

We verified the consistency of the corpus built by analyzing a sample of 20 Wikipedia articles. The output of CoreNLP and the information contained in the corpus match.
